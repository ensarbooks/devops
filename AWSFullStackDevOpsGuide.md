## 1. AWS Provider Configuration

Before provisioning any AWS resources with Terraform, you need to configure the AWS provider. The AWS provider configuration tells Terraform how to connect to AWS, which region to use, and what credentials or IAM role to use for authentication.

### 1.1 Setting Up AWS Provider

To configure the AWS provider, include a `provider` block in your Terraform configuration. At minimum, specify the AWS region. For example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"  # Use a specific major version of the AWS provider
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"   # Specify your AWS region
  # credentials are typically provided via environment or IAM role, not hard-coded here
}
```

- The `terraform.required_providers` block ensures the AWS provider plugin is downloaded.
- The `provider "aws"` block configures AWS settings. Here we set the region (e.g., `us-east-1`). You can also set a default region via environment variables like **AWS_REGION** or **AWS_DEFAULT_REGION**.

**Credentials:** It’s best **NOT** to hard-code AWS credentials in Terraform files. Instead, use one of these approaches:
- **Environment Variables:** Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in your shell environment. Terraform will pick these up automatically.
- **Shared Credentials File:** Use the `~/.aws/credentials` file (as used by AWS CLI).
- **IAM Role (Best Practice):** If Terraform runs on an EC2 instance or in AWS CloudShell, attach an IAM role to that environment. This avoids long-term keys altogether.

> **Security Tip:** Avoid putting AWS keys in plaintext in Terraform code. The Terraform getting-started guide shows an example of direct credentials in code, but that’s only for simplicity in tutorials and **not recommended for real environments**. Use external methods (env variables, IAM roles) for credentials to keep them out of source code and state files.

### 1.2 Using IAM Roles for Terraform

AWS **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles provide temporary credentials and are a secure way to run Terraform:
- When running Terraform on AWS (e.g., on an EC2 or in CI/CD), assign an IAM role with least privileges to the instance or runner. Terraform will automatically assume that role.
- IAM roles automatically rotate credentials and reduce the risk of leaked keys.
- Follow the **principle of least privilege**: The IAM role should have only the permissions needed to perform Terraform actions (e.g., create/read specific resources).

**Example:** If your Terraform code needs to manage EC2, S3, RDS, and ECS, create an IAM policy that allows only necessary actions on those services. Start with minimal permissions and add as needed, rather than using overly broad policies. Use AWS managed policies as a base if appropriate (for example, AWS has a `PowerUserAccess` or specific service policies), but prefer custom policies that grant only what’s required for your particular infrastructure.

### 1.3 Multiple AWS Profiles and Regions (Optional)

If you need to work with multiple AWS accounts or regions in one configuration, you can use multiple provider configurations:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west" 
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "log_bucket_west" {
  provider = aws.west
  bucket   = "my-logs-west"
  # ...
}
```
In this example, we define two AWS providers with aliases `west` and `east`. Resources can then explicitly reference which provider (and thus which region/account) to use. This is advanced usage; for a simple setup, one provider (as in 1.1) is sufficient.

### 1.4 Remote State Backend (Brief Mention)

When collaborating on Terraform in teams, it’s common to store the Terraform **state** remotely (e.g., in an S3 bucket with DynamoDB for locking). A remote state backend isn't strictly part of "provider configuration," but it's relevant for security:
- Use an encrypted S3 bucket for Terraform state. Enable bucket default encryption (SSE) so all state files are encrypted at rest.
- Restrict access to the state bucket to only the IAM roles/users running Terraform.
- Use DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent runs from corrupting state.

**Example Backend Block:**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-state-bucket"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "my-tf-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true  # ensures state is encrypted at rest
  }
}
```
This config stores state in `my-tf-state-bucket` with server-side encryption enabled. The DynamoDB table `my-tf-state-lock` will handle locking so only one Terraform process can modify state at a time.

## 2. VPC and Subnet Data Sources

In most AWS environments, you will either create a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or use an existing one. **Terraform Data Sources** allow you to query AWS for existing resources (like VPCs, subnets, or AMIs) and use those values in your configuration without having to hard-code them.

### 2.1 Understanding Data Sources

A **data source** in Terraform is a way to fetch information from AWS (or other providers) that is **read-only**. This is useful for referencing resources not managed by your current Terraform project. For example, you might have a VPC created outside Terraform (or in another Terraform project) and you need to get its ID to place new resources in it.

The syntax for a data source:
```hcl
data "<provider>_<resource>" "<name>" {
  # configuration (like filters or IDs to lookup)
}
```
- **provider_resource**: The type of resource to look up (e.g., `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet_ids`).
- **name**: An identifier you choose to reference this data elsewhere.

### 2.2 Querying an Existing VPC by Tag

Let’s say your AWS account already has a VPC that you want to use. If that VPC has a unique tag (for example, `Name = my-vpc`), you can retrieve it with a data source:

```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["my-vpc"]       # The Name tag of the VPC to look up
  }
}
```

This will find the VPC with Name tag "my-vpc". You can then use `data.aws_vpc.selected.id` in your resources to get the VPC’s ID. 

**Alternate approach:** If you know the VPC’s exact ID, you could use:
```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  id = "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
}
```
But using tags is more flexible when the ID might change between environments.

### 2.3 Querying Subnets – Data Source vs Resource Creation

Once you have the VPC, you often need **Subnets**. You might create subnets in Terraform or use existing ones. To fetch existing subnets, use **`aws_subnet`** or **`aws_subnet_ids`** data sources:
- `data "aws_subnet"` – fetches a single subnet (you’d typically filter by tag or ID).
- `data "aws_subnet_ids"` – fetches *all* subnet IDs in a VPC (optionally filtered by tags).

**Example:** Fetch a subnet by Name tag:
```hcl
data "aws_subnet" "selected" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["my-subnet-public-1"]
  }
}
# Use data.aws_subnet.selected.id when referencing this subnet
```
**Example:** Fetch multiple subnets (e.g., all private subnets in the VPC with a certain tag):
```hcl
data "aws_subnet_ids" "private_subnets" {
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  tags = {
    "Tier" = "Private"
  }
}
```
This finds all subnets in the given VPC that have a tag `Tier: Private`. The result `data.aws_subnet_ids.private_subnets.ids` will be a list of subnet IDs. 

You can use these IDs in other resources. For instance, to attach a resource in each of the found subnets, you might use a Terraform `for_each` or count. Or, as in the Stack Overflow example, pick one by index. For example:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = data.aws_subnet_ids.private_subnets.ids[count.index]
  # ...
}
```
This launches 3 EC2 instances, each in one of the subnets returned (assuming at least 3 subnets).

**Note:** The `aws_subnet_ids` data source returns an **unordered list** (TypeSet). So if you need a stable ordering, you might sort them outside of Terraform or use the `aws_subnets` data source (which returns a structure you can sort). But for most use cases, using them via index is fine as above.

### 2.4 Creating a New VPC and Subnets (Briefly)

If you choose to create a new VPC instead of using data sources:
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "my-vpc"
  }
}
resource "aws_subnet" "public1" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = { Name = "my-subnet-public-1" }
}
# ... additional subnets (public2, private1, private2, etc.) ...
```
However, in many organizations a central team might create VPCs, and application teams deploy into existing subnets. Data sources (as shown in 2.2 and 2.3) are very useful in those cases.

**Pitfall Alert:** When using data sources like `aws_vpc` or `aws_subnet_ids`, ensure the resources actually exist before running Terraform. If the filter returns nothing (e.g., wrong tag or the resource hasn't been created yet), Terraform will throw an error that the data resource cannot be found. Double-check your filters and run `terraform plan` to see if data lookup succeeds.

## 3. Security Groups

**Security Groups (SGs)** are virtual firewalls in AWS. They control inbound and outbound traffic for resources like EC2 instances, ECS tasks (with awsvpc networking), RDS databases, etc. In Terraform, security groups and their rules can be managed with `aws_security_group` and `aws_security_group_rule` resources.

### 3.1 Security Group Basics

An AWS security group consists of:
- **Inbound rules:** What traffic to allow into the resource.
- **Outbound rules:** What traffic to allow out (by default, AWS SGs allow all outbound).

All rules are permissive (there are no "deny" rules in SGs; anything not allowed is denied by default). Security groups are *stateful*: if inbound traffic is allowed, the response traffic is automatically allowed back out, and vice versa.

**Example Security Group Terraform resource:**
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "web-sg"
  description = "Security group for web servers"
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.selected.id  # attach to our VPC

  ingress = [
    {
      description      = "HTTP from anywhere"
      from_port        = 80
      to_port          = 80
      protocol         = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    },
    {
      description      = "HTTPS from anywhere"
      from_port        = 443
      to_port          = 443
      protocol         = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  ]

  egress = [
    {
      description      = "Allow all outbound"
      from_port        = 0
      to_port          = 0
      protocol         = "-1"
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Name = "web-sg"
  }
}
```
This defines a `web_sg` that allows inbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0), and allows all outbound traffic. In practice, you might restrict inbound to specific IPs or another security group for tighter security (discussed below).

**Note:** Terraform allows defining rules inline (as above) or as separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources. Inline rules are simpler for many cases. Use separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources if you need to manage rules independently or refer to them in counts/for_each.

### 3.2 Best Practices for Security Groups

**Principle of Least Privilege:** Only open the ports and sources necessary. For example, if only a certain CIDR or load balancer should talk to your instance, restrict to that, rather than `0.0.0.0/0` (anyone).

- **Deny-All by Default:** Start with no inbound rules (which means nothing allowed) or an explicit "deny all" mindset. Then add specific rules for what is needed. By default, a new SG has no inbound rules (so it denies all inbound).
- **Allow Specific IPs/CIDRs:** For example, for an SSH or RDP access SG, allow only your office IP or VPN range, not the whole internet. For a database SG, allow only the application servers’ SG as source.
- **Use Security Group as Source/Destination:** You can reference an SG in another SG’s rules. E.g., allow traffic from the ALB’s security group to the web server’s security group. This is often better than IPs because it automatically covers any instance with that SG.
- **Avoid Using the Default SG:** AWS’s default VPC security group allows all traffic between resources using it. It’s better to create custom SGs for each role (web, database, etc.) to isolate traffic.

**Example of SG reference:** Suppose we have an ALB SG and an ECS task (web server) SG:
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "alb_sg" {
  name   = "alb-sg"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  ingress = [
    {
      from_port   = 80, to_port = 80, protocol = "tcp",
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # ALB listens on HTTP from anywhere (could restrict)
    }
  ]
  egress = [
    { from_port = 0, to_port = 0, protocol = "-1", cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] }
  ]
}
resource "aws_security_group" "app_sg" {
  name   = "app-sg"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  ingress = [
    {
      from_port       = 3000, to_port = 3000, protocol = "tcp",
      security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb_sg.id]  # only ALB SG can access app port
    }
  ]
  egress = [
    { from_port = 0, to_port = 0, protocol = "-1", cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] }
  ]
}
```
In this snippet:
- The ALB’s SG (`alb_sg`) allows HTTP from anywhere (assuming the ALB will redirect to HTTPS or is internal, adjust accordingly).
- The app’s SG (`app_sg`) allows TCP/3000 inbound only from the ALB’s SG. That means only the load balancer can reach the app on port 3000. This is more secure than opening 3000 to all. It follows AWS best practices: *“configure security groups so that your EC2 (or ECS tasks) accept traffic only from the load balancer, and the ALB accepts traffic only on necessary ports from clients.”*.

**Outbound Rules:** By default Terraform/AWS sets outbound to “all allowed.” If your organization requires restricting outbound (some do), you can specify egress rules. Commonly you might allow only specific ports to specific ranges (for instance, database servers might only allow outbound to certain logging or backup endpoints). Most setups keep the default allow all egress and rely on network ACLs or route rules for further control as needed.

### 3.3 Security Groups for RDS, ECS, ALB, etc.

Each component in our architecture will have its own security group requirements:
- **ALB (Web Load Balancer):** Inbound 80/443 from Internet (or from a CDN/WAF if fronting it), outbound to the target instances. As shown, allow inbound from 0.0.0.0/0 on the listener ports (careful: for public ALB, that’s fine, but if internal ALB, restrict the source to your VPC or specific ranges). Outbound rules allow ALB to talk to targets on their ports.
- **ECS Tasks (Application containers):** Inbound from ALB on the container port, no direct public access. Outbound open (so containers can e.g. call external APIs, unless you want to restrict).
- **RDS Database:** Inbound only from application (ECS tasks or maybe a bastion for maintenance). Typically, you’d create an `aws_security_group` for RDS (e.g., `rds_sg`) and only allow ingress on port 3306 (MySQL’s port) from the `app_sg` (the ECS tasks or EC2 instances). No public ingress. Outbound can be open or restricted (databases often don’t need to call out except maybe to AWS services for backups).
- **Bastion/SSH (if any):** If you have a bastion host for admin access, it might have an SG that allows SSH from your IP, and your RDS SG might also allow the bastion’s SG on 3306 for admin queries. Just an example of layered access.
  
**Tagging SGs:** Tag your security groups with meaningful names and purpose (Name tag, Environment tag, etc.) to make auditing easier.

### 3.4 Common Pitfalls with Security Groups

- **Overly Permissive Rules:** A common mistake is leaving `0.0.0.0/0` open on ports that don’t need global access. Always re-evaluate if you can narrow it down (e.g., if an ALB is fronting your app, the app’s SG should not allow all, just the ALB). Overly permissive SG rules increase risk.
- **Missing SG Dependencies in Terraform:** If you reference one SG’s ID in another (like ALB SG in app SG), Terraform handles ordering automatically. But if you have circular dependencies (rare with SGs, but possible with self-references), you might need the `depends_on` to guide Terraform.
- **Hitting SG Limits:** AWS limits the number of rules per SG and SGs per ENI (network interface). For example, as of writing, you can have 60 inbound rules per SG (this includes each CIDR or SG reference as separate count). If you find Terraform complaining about too many rules, consider consolidating or using fewer broad rules where safe.
- **Stateful Behavior Assumptions:** Remember that security groups are stateful. You do not need to add an outbound rule to allow response traffic for an inbound rule. For instance, if inbound 3306 from app to DB is allowed, the response from DB to app is automatically allowed. Some newcomers mistakenly add redundant rules; it’s not harmful, but not needed.
- **Default SG Catch-All:** Don’t rely on the default VPC’s SG which allows all intra-VPC traffic. It’s better to isolate via custom SGs for each service role.

Now that networking and security groups are established, let’s move to provisioning the AWS services themselves, starting with RDS for a MySQL database.

---

## 4. RDS MySQL Database Instance

**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** makes it easy to set up a managed MySQL database. We will use Terraform to configure an RDS MySQL instance, demonstrating important settings like engine version, instance size, storage, subnets, and security. We’ll also incorporate **security best practices** like backups, Multi-AZ for high availability, and encryption at rest.

### 4.1 RDS Subnet Group

RDS instances reside within a VPC, but they don’t use normal subnets directly. Instead, they use a **DB Subnet Group** – a collection of subnets (usually in different AZs) where the RDS can place its primary and standby instances.

Create a subnet group selecting private subnets (so the DB is not in a public subnet):
```hcl
resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "my_db_subnet_group" {
  name       = "my-db-subnet-group"
  subnet_ids = data.aws_subnet_ids.private_subnets.ids  # using the data source from section 2
  tags = {
    Name = "my-db-subnet-group"
  }
}
```
Ensure the subnets you use have network access to the application and are in different Availability Zones for redundancy.

### 4.2 Creating the RDS MySQL Instance

The Terraform resource for RDS instances is `aws_db_instance`. Key parameters:
- `engine` and `engine_version` (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or 5.7).
- `instance_class` – size of the instance (db.t3.micro, db.t3.medium, etc.).
- `username` and `password` for the master user (credentials).
- `vpc_security_group_ids` – which SGs can access this DB.
- `db_subnet_group_name` – the subnet group for the DB.
- `allocated_storage` (if using IO1 storage, use `iops` as well).
- `multi_az` – true/false for multi-AZ deployment.
- `storage_encrypted` and `kms_key_id` – to encrypt the DB at rest.
- Backup settings: `backup_retention_period` and `backup_window`.
- Maintenance window and final snapshot settings.

**Example Terraform for RDS:**
```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "mysql_db" {
  identifier              = "my-app-db"            # name for the DB instance
  engine                  = "mysql"
  engine_version          = "8.0"                  # MySQL version
  instance_class          = "db.t3.medium"         # instance size
  allocated_storage       = 20                     # GB
  storage_type            = "gp2"                  # General Purpose SSD
  username                = var.db_master_username # avoid hardcoding, use vars
  password                = var.db_master_password # sensitive, use vars
  db_subnet_group_name    = aws_db_subnet_group.my_db_subnet_group.name
  vpc_security_group_ids  = [aws_security_group.rds_sg.id]  # defined in SG section
  multi_az                = true                   # enable multi-AZ deployment for HA
  storage_encrypted       = true                   # encrypt at rest
  kms_key_id              = aws_kms_key.rds.arn    # reference a KMS CMK for encryption
  backup_retention_period = 7                      # keep backups for 7 days
  backup_window           = "03:00-04:00"          # UTC time for backups
  maintenance_window      = "sun:05:00-sun:06:00"  # weekly maintenance window
  skip_final_snapshot     = false                  # take final snapshot on destroy
  final_snapshot_identifier = "my-app-db-final-snapshot"
  tags = {
    Name = "my-app-mysql-db"
  }
}
```

Let’s break down a few important settings:
- **Networking:** The `aws_db_instance` is associated with our VPC via the `db_subnet_group_name` and the security group. By using a private subnet group and a security group that doesn’t allow public ingress, we ensure the database is not publicly accessible (a critical security measure).
- **Multi-AZ:** Setting `multi_az = true` enables an RDS high-availability feature where AWS automatically provisions a standby in another AZ and replicates to it. On failure, it fails over to the standby. This significantly improves availability for production databases.
- **Storage Encryption:** We set `storage_encrypted = true` and provide a `kms_key_id`. This ensures data at rest on the DB instance is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service. Encryption at rest is often required for compliance (e.g., HIPAA, PCI) and is a best practice. Note that you **cannot enable encryption on an existing unencrypted RDS instance** – it must be set at creation time. If you need to encrypt an existing DB, you must create a snapshot and restore it to a new encrypted instance.
- **Backups:** `backup_retention_period = 7` means daily automated backups are kept for 7 days. This allows point-in-time recovery within that window. `backup_window` sets when backups occur (pick a low-traffic time). Automated backups are highly recommended so you can recover from data loss or corruption to a recent point.
- **Maintenance Window:** This is when AWS may apply patches (e.g., minor version upgrades) that can cause a short downtime. Choose a time that least impacts users.
- **Final Snapshot:** By keeping `skip_final_snapshot = false`, Terraform will snapshot the database if you destroy it. This is a safety net so you don’t accidentally lose data. You provide a `final_snapshot_identifier` name. In our example, if the DB is destroyed, it creates a snapshot named "my-app-db-final-snapshot."

**Parameter Group and Option Group (Optional):** If you need custom DB parameters (like changing the default `wait_timeout` or other MySQL settings), you can manage an `aws_db_parameter_group` resource and specify it via `parameter_group_name`. Similarly, for certain engines like Oracle or SQL Server, you might use `aws_db_option_group`. For MySQL, parameter group is commonly used if you need to tweak settings, but if defaults are fine, you can skip it (or use the default provided by AWS).

### 4.3 Security Best Practices for RDS

- **No Public Access:** Ensure `publicly_accessible` is set to `false` (the default in most cases, since we used a subnet group of private subnets). This prevents a public IP from being assigned. Only your app servers in the same VPC (or VPN/Bastion) should reach the DB.
- **Least Privilege SG:** The RDS security group should allow incoming MySQL (3306) only from the application’s security group (or specific IP if needed). We set that up in section 3 with `aws_security_group.rds_sg` presumably allowing source from `app_sg`. Do not allow `0.0.0.0/0` to DB SG.
- **Encryption:** As noted, always enable storage encryption for production data. Use KMS Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) if you need control (or AWS-managed RDS key if you prefer simplicity). Also enforce encryption in transit: when connecting to the database, use SSL. In Terraform, you can’t enforce that at the instance level (it’s an application connection setting), but you can require it in your database user policies or security practices. For compliance like HIPAA, encrypting data at rest and in transit is mandatory.
- **Backups and PITR:** Keep backups enabled. 7 days is common, some choose 14 or more for extra safety. Monitor backup storage usage though (beyond retention, old backups drop off).
- **Multi-AZ for Prod:** For production environments, Multi-AZ is strongly recommended for high availability. For dev/test or cost-saving, you might disable it, but be aware of the downtime risk.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Enable RDS enhanced monitoring and audit logs if needed. In Terraform, you can set `monitoring_interval = 60` (seconds) and create an IAM role for RDS to push logs to CloudWatch (the example above uses `monitoring_role_arn = aws_iam_role.rds_monitoring_role.arn`). You can also enable `performance_insights_enabled = true` for advanced performance monitoring (and optionally `performance_insights_retention_period`).
- **Upgrades:** Pin a major engine version, but apply minor version upgrades regularly. Terraform won’t auto-upgrade your DB version unless you change `engine_version` in config, but AWS can automatically apply minor patches in the maintenance window if enabled.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- *Credentials in State:* The master password will be stored in the Terraform state (unless you mark it sensitive in output). Do not output the password, and consider using AWS Secrets Manager to rotate/manage DB credentials instead of keeping in TF vars (see section 10 on secrets management).
- *Applying Changes:* Certain changes (like instance class, multi_az, storage type) can be done in-place by AWS, but others (like turning on encryption or changing engine version major) require replacement. Plan carefully to avoid unexpected DB replacements. If Terraform shows a replacement, make sure you know the impact (downtime, data migration).
- *Parameter Group changes:* If you attach a custom parameter group, some changes won’t apply until a DB reboot. Plan accordingly with maintenance windows.

With the database in place, let’s proceed to setting up our compute environment with **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** to run application tasks in Docker containers.

## 5. ECS Cluster and Related Resources

**Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** allows you to run containerized applications at scale. We will focus on the Fargate launch type (serverless containers) for simplicity, although you could use ECS with EC2 instances as well. In this section, we set up an ECS cluster and any supporting resources (like IAM roles for ECS).

### 5.1 ECS Cluster

An **ECS Cluster** is a logical grouping of resources where your tasks and services run. If using Fargate, the cluster doesn’t need much configuration (just a name). If using EC2 launch type, you’d also manage an Auto Scaling group of instances to join the cluster.

**Terraform resource for ECS cluster:**
```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "app_cluster" {
  name = "my-app-cluster"
  tags = {
    Name = "my-app-cluster"
  }
}
```
This simply creates an ECS cluster named "my-app-cluster". On its own, an empty cluster does little, but it’s where we’ll deploy services. As a standalone resource, it doesn't require any special configuration besides name and maybe capacity providers.

**(Optional)** *Capacity Providers:* If you plan to use EC2 instances for tasks or a mix of Fargate Spot, you can set up capacity providers. For Fargate, AWS has default capacity providers (`FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT`). For EC2, you create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and then an `aws_ecs_capacity_provider` linking that ASG to the cluster. Given our focus on Fargate (to avoid managing EC2 fleets), we won't go deep into ASGs. But note, capacity providers allow sophisticated control over how tasks are distributed between on-demand vs spot, etc..

By default, if you run Fargate tasks, you can just refer to launch type "FARGATE" without explicitly defining a capacity provider in Terraform (AWS will use the implicit one).

### 5.2 ECS IAM Roles

ECS tasks and services require certain AWS IAM roles:
- **Task Execution Role:** Allows ECS to pull container images (from ECR) and send logs to CloudWatch on your behalf. AWS provides a managed policy `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` for this. The default name is `ecsTaskExecutionRole`.
- **Task Role (Optional):** If your application (inside the container) needs to call AWS services (e.g., read from S3, or call an API), you can provide an IAM role that the application can assume. This is specified as `task_role_arn` in the task definition (Section 6). It’s analogous to an EC2 instance profile but for the container. It’s not always needed; if your containers don't call AWS APIs or you handle keys differently, you may skip.
- **ECS Service Role:** In older ECS (pre-Fargate or before certain features), a service could use a role to use load balancer actions. Nowadays, if you use the new ALB integration, you typically just need to ensure the ALB's target group is correct and the ECS service uses the right settings. The AWSVPC networking also attaches an elastic network interface to your tasks, which might use your ECS agent's IAM (handled by AWS).

**Defining the Task Execution Role in Terraform:**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task_exec_role" {
  name = "ecsTaskExecutionRole"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.ecs_task_assume.json
}
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "ecs_task_assume" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
}
# Attach the AWS managed policy for ECS task execution
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecs_task_exec_role_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"
}
```
This creates a role that can be assumed by ECS tasks (`ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` principal) and attaches the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy which includes permissions like:
- Pulling images from ECR (or other repositories).
- Writing logs to CloudWatch.
- (If needed by your config) using secrets from Secrets Manager or Systems Manager parameter store.

AWS actually can create this role for you when you first run an ECS task via console. In Terraform, if you want to use that default, you could skip creating it and use a data source:
```hcl
data "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task_exec_role" {
  name = "ecsTaskExecutionRole"
}
```
This presupposes it exists. The Stack Overflow example notes how to do this. In our guide, we explicitly create it for completeness.

**Task Role:** If needed:
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task_app_role" {
  name = "ecs-app-task-role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.ecs_task_assume.json  # same assume policy but maybe include "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
}
# Attach custom policies or managed as needed, e.g., access to S3
```
We would then later set `task_role_arn = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_app_role.arn` in the task definition to give the container these permissions.

**ECS Cluster Instance Role:** (Only if using EC2 launch type) – If you had EC2 instances, those instances would need an IAM role (with policies to allow joining cluster, pulling images, etc.). With Fargate, this is not applicable.

### 5.3 CloudWatch Log Group (for ECS)

It is good practice to create a CloudWatch Log Group for your application logs if you use the `awslogs` log driver for ECS (which we will in the task definition). By creating it yourself, you can retain logs for a specified period and ensure the log group isn't accidentally deleted on task stop.

**Example:**
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "app_log_group" {
  name              = "/ecs/my-app"
  retention_in_days = 30  # keep logs for 30 days (adjust as needed)
}
```
We will reference this log group name in the ECS task definition so that container logs go to CloudWatch.

### 5.4 Networking Considerations for ECS

Since we use Fargate with awsvpc mode, each ECS task will get its own elastic network interface (ENI) and a private IP in our subnets. We should ensure:
- We deploy tasks into the correct subnets (likely the private subnets, behind the ALB). We’ll specify those in the ECS service network configuration.
- The security group for the tasks (`app_sg` from section 3) is applied to the ENIs. This will happen via the ECS service definition.
- Our subnets have the needed route to the internet (for pulling images, etc.). If they are private subnets, they should have a NAT Gateway or other egress to allow pulling the Docker image from ECR or Docker Hub, unless the image is in a VPC-accessible repository. Alternatively, if you use VPC endpoints for ECR and CloudWatch, you could run truly isolated, but that’s advanced. For now, ensure a NAT Gateway if needed so Fargate tasks can pull the image.

**Example NAT Gateway Setup (if not already in environment):**
```hcl
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public1.id
}
resource "aws_route_table" "public_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
  }
  # associate with public subnets...
}
resource "aws_route_table" "private_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.nat.id
  }
  # associate with private subnets...
}
```
This is simplified, but ensures instances in private subnets can access the internet via NAT. If your infrastructure already has this, no need to duplicate it.

Now we have an ECS cluster ready, with necessary IAM roles and networking, we can move on to defining the application **task definition**.

---

## 6. ECS Task Definition

An **ECS Task Definition** is like a blueprint for your containerized application. It specifies:
- What Docker image to run.
- How many CPU and memory units to allocate.
- What ports to expose.
- Environment variables or secrets.
- What IAM role the task can assume (task role).
- Networking mode, logging configuration, and more.

In ECS, you can define multiple containers in a single task (for sidecar patterns), but here we’ll assume a single container (e.g., a web application).

### 6.1 Defining a Task Definition in Terraform

Terraform uses the `aws_ecs_task_definition` resource. Key arguments include:
- `family` – a name for the task definition family.
- `network_mode` – for Fargate, must be `awsvpc` (each task gets its own network interface).
- `requires_compatibilities` – for Fargate tasks, specify `["FARGATE"]`.
- `cpu` and `memory` – task size (Fargate requires these).
- `execution_role_arn` – the IAM role for ECS agent actions (pull images, logs) – this is the task execution role from section 5.
- `task_role_arn` – (optional) IAM role that the container can use for AWS API calls (the app role if needed).
- `container_definitions` – a JSON string (or use Terraform’s `jsonencode()` function) for the container settings.

**Example Task Definition:**
```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "app_task" {
  family                   = "my-app-task"
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  cpu                      = 256    # 0.25 vCPU
  memory                   = 512    # 0.5 GB
  execution_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_exec_role.arn
  task_role_arn            = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_app_role.arn   # if you have a task role
  container_definitions    = jsonencode([
    {
      name      = "my-app-container"
      image     = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest"
      essential = true
      portMappings = [
        {
          containerPort = 3000
          hostPort      = 3000
          protocol      = "tcp"
        }
      ]
      environment = [
        { name = "ENV", value = "production" },
        { name = "DB_HOST", value = aws_db_instance.mysql_db.address },
        # ... other env vars, avoid putting secrets here (use AWS Secrets if needed)
      ]
      logConfiguration = {
        logDriver = "awslogs"
        options = {
          awslogs-group         = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.app_log_group.name
          awslogs-region        = "us-east-1"
          awslogs-stream-prefix = "ecs"
        }
      }
    }
  ])
}
```

Breaking down important parts:
- `requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]` along with `network_mode = "awsvpc"` signals this is a Fargate task definition.
- `cpu` and `memory` are defined in CPU units and MiB respectively. ECS Fargate has specific combinations allowed (256 CPU with 512 memory as one of the smallest combos). This example uses 0.25 vCPU and 512 MB.
- `execution_role_arn` is set to our previously created `ecsTaskExecutionRole`. This is **required for Fargate tasks**, otherwise your task will fail to start because it can't pull the container image or write logs (Terraform might not catch that in plan since it's an AWS runtime requirement).
- `task_role_arn` is optional; if your container needs AWS permissions (e.g., reading from S3), provide a role here. If not needed, you can omit it or leave empty.
- `container_definitions`: We used Terraform’s `jsonencode` to avoid manually JSON formatting. Inside:
  - `name`: Name of the container.
  - `image`: The container image to run. In this example, it's referencing an ECR repository by its URI. Make sure the image exists (and your execution role has permission to pull it). Could be a Docker Hub image as well (then no auth needed for public images).
  - `essential`: true, meaning if this container stops, the task is considered failed (for multiple containers scenario).
  - `portMappings`: We map container port 3000 to host port 3000. In awsvpc mode, hostPort must equal containerPort for Fargate, and these will be the port on the ENI.
  - `environment`: passing some environment variables (non-sensitive). We demonstrate passing the RDS endpoint as `DB_HOST`. For sensitive config like passwords, it’s better to use Secrets Manager and ECS secrets integration rather than plain environment variables.
  - `logConfiguration`: using awslogs driver to send logs to CloudWatch. We specify the log group name and a prefix. This requires that the execution role has permission to create log streams and put logs (the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy covers that).

If you need to specify **Docker labels, health check, working directory, entrypoint, command**, etc., those can also be added under container definitions. Check the AWS docs or Terraform resource docs for all possible fields.

**Multi-Container Task?** If you had, say, a sidecar container (like a proxy or agent), you would add another object in the `jsonencode([ ... ])` array with its settings. You might also then set `dependsOn` within container definitions if one container should start after another.

**JSON Encoding Tip:** In Terraform 0.12+, `jsonencode()` is your friend. Write the container definition as HCL map structure (as we did) and wrap in jsonencode. That avoids dealing with complex escaping.

### 6.2 Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting for Task Definitions

- **Execution Role Not Set (Fargate):** If you forget `execution_role_arn` for a Fargate task, the task will not be able to start, often resulting in an error like "Unable to assume role" or you'll see it stuck in PROVISIONING. Always set the execution role.
- **Task Size too Low/High:** Ensure the CPU and memory combination is valid. AWS Fargate has a limited set of allowed combinations (e.g., 256 CPU requires at least 512 memory, max 2048 memory for that CPU; if you choose 1024 CPU, memory must be between 2048 and 8192, etc.). If invalid, Terraform might apply successfully (since AWS checks at run), but the task will fail to run. Double-check the AWS docs for valid Fargate sizes.
- **Port Conflicts:** In awsvpc, each task gets its own IP, so port conflicts are usually not an issue (each task’s port 3000 is on a different IP). But if you were on EC2 with bridge networking, mapping multiple tasks on one host to same host port would conflict. So awsvpc avoids that complexity.
- **Log Configuration Issues:** If logs aren’t appearing in CloudWatch, check that the log group exists (our config creates it) and that the execution role has `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess` or specifically allowed logs operations (the managed policy covers it). Also, check the `awslogs-region` is correct.
- **Image Pull Issues:** If using a private image repository (like a private Docker Hub or custom registry), you might need to add repository credentials to ECS. With AWS ECR, as long as the execution role can pull (ECR repository policy or IAM permissions allow it), it should work. Ensure the repository URI is correct and the image tag exists. If you push a new image version, typically you'd update the task definition with the new image tag (or use the "latest" tag but that has its own considerations).
- **Task Role usage:** If your application (inside container) fails to access AWS resources, it could be that the task role isn't set or doesn't have needed permissions. Remember the execution role is only for ECS agent actions, not for your app’s API calls. So if your app needs S3, attach a policy to the task IAM role granting S3 access, and ensure `task_role_arn` is that role.
- **Working Directory and Commands:** If your container needs a specific entrypoint or command, define it. If omitted, it uses the image’s default. A common mistake is forgetting to set the proper command and the container exits immediately.

With the task definition created, we have a reusable definition for our app. Now we can deploy it as a running service with an Application Load Balancer in front of it.

---

## 7. Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)

In this section, we set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic to our ECS tasks. The ALB will handle HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients and forward them to the ECS service tasks (our containers running the app). We will also cover target groups, listeners, and integrating ALB with ECS.

### 7.1 Creating an Application Load Balancer

The ALB itself is an AWS resource that requires:
- Subnets to run in (usually two or more subnets for high availability, typically public subnets for an internet-facing ALB).
- A security group to control traffic to it (as discussed in section 3).
- Setting whether it’s internet-facing or internal.

**Terraform for ALB:**
```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "app_alb" {
  name            = "my-app-alb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  internal        = false                        # false for internet-facing; true for internal
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb_sg.id]
  subnets         = data.aws_subnet_ids.public_subnets.ids  # suppose we have a data source or variable for public subnets
  enable_deletion_protection = false             # set true for prod to avoid accidental deletion
  ip_address_type = "ipv4"
  tags = {
    Name = "my-app-alb"
  }
}
```
This defines an internet-facing ALB in our public subnets, using the `alb_sg` security group. Deletion protection is off here (for dev/test), but consider enabling in production to prevent accidental deletion of the LB (which would drop traffic).

### 7.2 Target Group for ECS Tasks

A **Target Group** holds the targets that the ALB will route traffic to. For ECS Fargate, the targets are identified by IP addresses (the private IP of each task’s ENI) because the tasks run in awsvpc mode without a fixed instance ID. So we use `target_type = "ip"`.

Key settings for a target group:
- `port` and `protocol` (port the app listens on, e.g., 3000, and typically HTTP for the connection from ALB to container if within the VPC).
- `target_type`: "ip" for awsvpc mode tasks, "instance" for instance IDs (EC2 mode or other targets).
- `vpc_id`: the VPC where targets reside.
- Health check configuration: path, interval, etc.

**Terraform Target Group:**
```hcl
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "app_tg" {
  name        = "my-app-tg"
  port        = 3000
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  target_type = "ip"
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  health_check {
    path                = "/health"   # your app's health endpoint
    interval            = 30
    timeout             = 5
    healthy_threshold   = 3
    unhealthy_threshold = 3
    matcher             = "200-399"
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "my-app-tg"
  }
}
```
We assume our application has a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK if healthy. We configure the ALB to check this every 30 seconds. You might adjust thresholds depending on how quickly you want to detect unhealthy targets.

If no specific health check path is set, ALB defaults to “/” (root) and expects 200. Setting a specific path is better for apps.

### 7.3 Listeners and Listener Rules

A **Listener** tells the ALB what to do on a certain port/protocol (like 80 or 443). We typically set up:
- HTTP (80) listener that redirects to HTTPS.
- HTTPS (443) listener that forwards to target group.

To use HTTPS, you need an SSL certificate (from AWS Certificate Manager). Let’s assume you have one (e.g., ARN is in a variable or data source).

**Listener Terraform:**
```hcl
resource "aws_lb_listener" "http_listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.app_alb.arn
  port              = 80
  protocol          = "HTTP"
  default_action {
    type             = "redirect"
    redirect {
      port        = "443"
      protocol    = "HTTPS"
      status_code = "HTTP_301"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_lb_listener" "https_listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.app_alb.arn
  port              = 443
  protocol          = "HTTPS"
  ssl_policy        = "ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08"  # an example security policy
  certificate_arn   = var.acm_certificate_arn      # ARN of your ACM certificate
  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.app_tg.arn
  }
}
```
What’s happening:
- The HTTP listener (80) will redirect all requests to HTTPS on the same host. This is a best practice to ensure encryption in transit (use HTTPS for all client traffic).
- The HTTPS listener (443) has an SSL certificate (from ACM) and forwards requests to our target group (app_tg). We could also set up rules here if we had different paths or host-based routing, but with one app, default forward is fine.

**Security Note:** The ALB terminates HTTPS and then communicates with targets over HTTP by default (as we set protocol HTTP to target). If your security policy requires end-to-end encryption, you could set up the target group with HTTPS and have the container serve HTTPS (more complex due to certificate on container, etc.). In many internal systems, ALB to target over HTTP in the VPC is acceptable, but if needed, you can do end-to-end TLS.

Ensure the security group rules reflect these:
- ALB SG allows 80/443 from internet (0.0.0.0/0) [if public].
- App SG allows 3000 from ALB SG (as we did).
- The ALB’s outbound to the app will be on port 3000, and our app SG ingress on 3000 from ALB SG covers it.

### 7.4 Registering Targets – via ECS Service

We don't manually register targets in Terraform when using ECS. Instead, the ECS Service (in next section) will attach the tasks to the ALB target group automatically. We will configure the ECS service with the target group ARN and container details.

However, Terraform’s dependency graph should know about the target group before creating the service. We’ll ensure the service depends on the target group and listeners (it will if we pass ARNs).

### 7.5 Best Practices for ALB and Security

- **HTTPS Only:** Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS as shown. This ensures encrypted traffic. AWS ALB supports TLS 1.2+; use a recommended security policy (like ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 or updated ones) which enforce modern TLS (the AWS docs recommend at least TLS 1.2 and prefer TLS 1.3).
- **Cert Management:** Use AWS Certificate Manager for your certificates. It’s free for public certs and integrates with ALB easily. Renewals are automatic. Just request a cert for your domain and use the ARN.
- **Idle Timeout:** Default is 60 seconds for ALB. If your app uses long connections, you might adjust `idle_timeout` in `aws_lb` resource.
- **Deletion Protection:** On production, set `enable_deletion_protection = true` on `aws_lb` to avoid accidental deletion via Terraform or console (which would drop all traffic).
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** If this is a public facing app, consider attaching an AWS WAF to the ALB for an extra layer of protection against common web threats. In Terraform, you could use `aws_wafv2_web_acl` and associate with ALB.
- **Logging:** Enable ALB access logs (to S3) for auditing. Terraform resource `aws_lb` can set `access_logs` with bucket name and prefix.
- **Target Group Health Checks:** Tune the health check to your app’s needs. Our example uses path "/health". Ensure your app can handle that path being hit. If deploying new tasks, consider using slow start (ALB feature) if needed for apps that need warm-up.
- **SG Tightening:** As noted before, ALB SG open to world on 443 is common for public site. If internal, lock it to known CIDRs. For app SG, allowing only ALB is crucial – you don't want someone to bypass the ALB and hit container IPs directly. Since the containers are in private subnets, that risk is low, but if someone got into your VPC, the SG stops them.

### 7.6 Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting (ALB)

- **Listeners Not Working:** If you get an error creating listeners about certificate, ensure the ACM cert is in the same region and owned by your account. Also ensure ACM has validated the domain.
- **No Targets in Target Group:** If after deploying ECS service you see 0 targets healthy, it could mean the service didn't attach tasks. Check the ECS service logs/events. It might be a misconfiguration in the service (like a wrong container name/port in the service definition).
- **Health Check Failing:** If health checks fail, the ALB will mark targets unhealthy and not send traffic. If your tasks start but immediately go unhealthy, verify:
  - Security group from ALB to task allows the health check traffic (we did allow 3000 from ALB SG).
  - The health check path is correct and your app is responding in time with a 200. If your app needs more time to start up, consider setting a longer `healthy_threshold` or adding a `grace_period` in ECS service (which we can do in ECS service for new tasks).
- **ALB Not Deleting:** If you try to destroy and it errors, likely deletion protection or the ALB is still associated with the ECS service. Terraform usually handles ordering (it deletes service before ALB), but if not, set `force_destroy` on the LB or remove the association first.
- **Capacity:** ALB can handle a lot of traffic, but ensure your subnets have enough IPs (each ALB node will use an IP in each AZ, and each task uses an IP). For large scale, plan subnet sizes accordingly (a /24 can handle 250+ IPs which is usually fine).
- **Cross-zone Load Balancing:** Enabled by default for ALB, meaning it will spread traffic across AZs evenly. You can toggle it with `enable_cross_zone_load_balancing` in `aws_lb_target_group` if needed.

Now our ALB is ready. Next, let's deploy the ECS Service to run our tasks and link everything together.

---

## 8. ECS Service

An **ECS Service** is used to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition in a cluster. It integrates with the load balancer to register tasks, and can optionally enable auto-scaling. We will create an ECS service to launch our application task (from section 6) in the cluster (section 5) and attach it to the ALB (section 7).

### 8.1 Creating an ECS Service in Terraform

Key settings for an `aws_ecs_service`:
- `cluster` – which ECS cluster to use.
- `task_definition` – which task definition to run (family and revision or ARN).
- `desired_count` – how many tasks to run.
- `launch_type` or `platform_version` – for Fargate, specify launch_type = "FARGATE".
- `network_configuration` – subnets and security groups for tasks (awsvpc networking).
- `load_balancer` – to attach to ALB (specify target group, container name, container port).
- Deployment configuration like maximum percent, minimum healthy percent (controls rolling updates).

**Example ECS Service:**

  }

  tags = {
    Name = "my-app-service"
  }
}
```

Explanation:
- We name the service and attach it to our cluster and task definition.
- `desired_count = 2` means we want two tasks running. ECS will ensure two tasks are always running (unless you scale or deploy with a new task def).
- `network_configuration`: We specify the private subnets and the `app_sg` security group for our tasks. `assign_public_ip = false` ensures these tasks only get private IPs (since private subnets, they wouldn't get public anyway unless explicitly enabled).
- `load_balancer`: We link the service to the ALB target group. We must provide the target group ARN, the container name and port that the ALB should route to. The container name and port must match those in the task definition (we used "my-app-container" and 3000).
- The service will register each running task's IP to the target group under the hood. It will also deregister on task stop.
- Deployment settings: `deployment_maximum_percent` and `minimum_healthy_percent` control how many tasks can be started or stopped during update. The default for these for Fargate is 200% max (meaning it can spin up new tasks up to doubling desired count during update) and 50% min healthy (meaning it can drop to half the desired count during rolling). We explicitly set them to defaults here. For a rolling deployment with no downtime, these defaults work (e.g., for desired 2, during deploy it can start 2 new (total 4, 200%) then stop old ones going no lower than 2*50%=1 running at a time).
- Lifecycle ignore_changes on task_definition: This is an optional tweak. Sometimes you manage deployments by updating the task definition outside Terraform (like CI/CD pipeline). If so, you'd set TF to ignore changes to `task_definition` so it doesn't try to revert to an older revision or force a new deploy. If you intend to deploy via Terraform (e.g., bump image tag and run Terraform), then remove that `lifecycle` block so Terraform will update the service with the new task definition ARN.

**Auto Scaling (Optional):** You can add an `aws_appautoscaling_target` and policies for the ECS service if you want it to scale based on CPU or custom CloudWatch metrics. That’s beyond scope here, but keep in mind for production auto-scaling of tasks is useful.

### 8.2 Running the Service and Verification

Once Terraform applies, the ECS service will:
- Launch 2 tasks of the specified task definition.
- Attach them to the ALB target group.
- You should be able to go to the ALB DNS name (output it or find in AWS console) and reach your application via the load balancer.

**Outputs (Optional):** You might output the ALB DNS for convenience:
```hcl
output "alb_dns_name" {
  value = aws_lb.app_alb.dns_name
}
```
After apply, use that URL (and if it’s a bare ALB with no path, ensure your app responds, maybe it’s an API so perhaps integrate with Route53 and domain in real scenario).

### 8.3 Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting (ECS Service)

- **Service Not Steady:** After creation, check the ECS console or use AWS CLI `aws ecs describe-services` to see service events. Common issues:
  - **Stopped tasks:** If tasks keep failing health check or exiting, the service will replace them and you might see "service ... is unable to consistently start tasks successfully". In that case, troubleshoot the task (logs in CloudWatch, or describe tasks to see stopped reason).
  - **Incorrect container name/port in service load_balancer block:** If these don’t match exactly the task def, ECS won’t know what to attach. The service might show as active but ALB target group has no targets. It’s easy to miss subtle differences, e.g., container name is case sensitive.
- **IAM Permissions:** The ECS service itself doesn’t need a role (unless you enable service autoscaling or a service-linked role, which AWS auto-manages). If you see errors about unable to register targets, AWS might be creating a service-linked role for you (usually first time it does automatically). Make sure your account’s IAM can create that (it should by default).
- **Scaling Adjustments:** If you manually scale tasks in console or by other means, Terraform will see drift (desired_count). It’s fine to scale via Terraform by updating `desired_count` or by an external autoscaler but be mindful of which source of truth you use.
- **Draining on Delete:** If you `terraform destroy`, by default it will remove the service (which will set desired count to 0 and deregister tasks). If you have deletion protection on ALB or other ties, ensure the order is correct (Terraform should delete service, target group, then ALB).
- **Service Discovery (Optional):** ECS can integrate with AWS Cloud Map for service discovery if not using ALB. We won’t cover that here, but if needed, you can add a `service_registries` block.

### 8.4 Optimizations

- **Rolling Update vs Blue/Green:** ECS supports blue/green deployments via CodeDeploy or other mechanisms. With Terraform, the default is a rolling update in-place. For an intermediate user, rolling update is usually sufficient.
- **Task Stop Grace Period:** If your tasks take time to shut down on SIGTERM, you can set `deployment_controller` or `stop_timeout` settings so ECS gives them time before force killing.
- **Tune Health Check Grace Period:** ECS service has a `health_check_grace_period_seconds` option. For example, if your app takes 2 minutes to start serving health check, you can set grace period so ALB health checks are ignored for that long after a task starts. This can avoid killing tasks prematurely. 
- **Capacity Providers in Service:** If you set up capacity providers, you can reference them in `capacity_provider_strategy` instead of launch_type. For Fargate, AWS recently suggests using capacity providers "FARGATE" and "FARGATE_SPOT" with weights, to save cost by running some tasks on spot. That is advanced, but something to explore.

Now that our service is deployed, we have a fully working stack: AWS provider configured, network (VPC/subnets) prepared, security groups locking down traffic, an RDS database, ECS cluster and tasks running our app, an ALB front-end, and an ECS service gluing them. 

We should cover some **troubleshooting and optimization** steps general to Terraform and AWS, and then summarize security best practices.

## 9. Troubleshooting and Optimization

Even with a solid plan, you might encounter errors or want to refine the setup. This section provides common Terraform issues (especially related to AWS) and how to troubleshoot them, as well as optimization tips for infrastructure and Terraform code organization.

### 9.1 Common Terraform Errors (AWS Context)

**Authentication Errors:** If Terraform says *"No valid credential sources found for AWS Provider"* or *"AWS provider requires credentials"*, it means it can’t find your AWS creds. Double-check:
- Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, etc.) are set or your AWS CLI default profile is configured.
- If using an IAM role (on EC2), ensure you didn’t specify static credentials that override it. And that the EC2 metadata is accessible (no metadata hop limit issues).
- If using `profile` in provider, ensure the profile exists in `~/.aws/credentials` or config.

**Permission Errors:** e.g., Terraform error *"Error creating IAM Role: AccessDenied"* or similar for other resources. This indicates the credentials Terraform is using are not allowed to perform that action. For example, trying to create an IAM role with an IAM user that itself lacks IAM permissions. Solution: adjust the IAM user/role running Terraform to have necessary permissions (or run with admin privileges if appropriate). Always align your runner’s IAM policy with what you intend to manage (as least privilege as possible).

**Dependency Errors:** Sometimes you get errors about resources not found or dependency cycles:
- *Resource Not Found:* If a data source can’t find something (e.g., your data "aws_vpc" returns nothing because the tag was wrong), Terraform plan/apply fails. Fix the inputs or ensure the resource exists. 
- *Dependency Cycle:* This is rarer, but can happen if you inadvertently create circular references (e.g., resource A depends on B’s attribute, and B depends on A). Terraform will catch this and refuse to plan. You need to break the cycle, often by using data sources or re-thinking the architecture. 
- *Invalid Index or Reference:* If you try to index into a list that is empty or not yet known, or refer to a resource that is in a module that might not have run, you can get such errors. Use `terraform console` to inspect values if needed during debug.

**AWS Service Quotas:** AWS has default quotas per region (e.g., 5 VPCs, 50 security groups, etc.). Terraform might fail if you exceed these (error messages from AWS often contain *LimitExceeded* or similar). For example, launching a large number of Fargate tasks might hit ENI limits per account. Monitor and request quota increases from AWS as needed (like Fargate OnDemand resource count, etc.).

**State Locking Issues:** If you use remote state with DynamoDB, occasionally you might see *"Error acquiring state lock"* if a previous run didn't release it (crash, etc.). You can manually unlock with `terraform force-unlock` (careful with this). Ensure only one Terraform runs at a time on a state.

### 9.2 Debugging AWS Resource Issues

**ECS Troubleshooting:** Use AWS ECS console or CLI to get task logs and events:
- `aws ecs describe-services --cluster my-app-cluster --services my-app-service` – shows events like deployments, failed tasks.
- `aws ecs list-tasks/describe-tasks` – to see stopped task reasons (e.g., OOM, or exit code).
- CloudWatch Logs – we set up logging, so check the log group for our task `/ecs/my-app/*` for app output or errors.

**RDS Connectivity Issues:** If the app can’t connect to DB:
- Check SG rules (does app SG allow to DB SG?). 
- Check that the `DB_HOST` we passed is correct (Terraform `aws_db_instance.address` should be the endpoint).
- If using TLS for DB connection, ensure the app trusts AWS RDS CA or you're not requiring but not using TLS (consistency).
- Try connectivity from a bastion if available (maybe use `aws ssm` Session Manager in the app task or an EC2 instance to test).
- RDS Console shows any maintenance or errors. Also, ensure the RDS instance is in "available" status (Terraform might say complete but maybe it was still initializing on first run).

**ALB Health:** If ALB target is unhealthy, we covered that. ALB access logs (if enabled) can show if requests are reaching and what statuses.

**Terraform Plan Changes:** If you run `terraform plan` again after initial apply and see unexpected changes, examine them:
- Sometimes default or computed values cause noise (e.g., AWS might add a default tag or something in Terraform state). Use the `lifecycle.ignore_changes` wisely to ignore those if they are benign.
- If you see changes to security group egress (Terraform may show changes to re-order rules or a default rule), it might not actually need to apply. Often re-running apply will make no difference if AWS returns things in different order. The AWS provider tries to normalize, but minor versions might have quirks.
- If you want to avoid redeploying ECS service every time the task definition changes (and you handle outside of TF), you already saw we can ignore task_definition changes. Conversely, if you want Terraform to handle deploy, make sure you *don’t* ignore it, and you update the task definition resource (new image tag or any field) so a new revision is created and service updated.

### 9.3 Optimizing Terraform Code Structure

As infrastructure grows, consider organizing into modules:
- **Network Module:** Could encapsulate VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups. Many organizations have a centralized network module.
- **ECS Cluster Module:** If you have multiple clusters or complex ASG, use a module (or the community AWS ECS module).
- **RDS Module:** Can wrap RDS instance and related (subnet group, parameter group).
- Using modules can make your configuration more readable and reusable across environments (dev/prod differences via variables).

Use Terraform variables and workspaces for environment-specific values (like different instance sizes for prod, or desired_count maybe higher in prod). This prevents duplicating code.

### 9.4 Cost Optimizations

Be mindful of costs for this infrastructure:
- **EC2 vs Fargate:** Fargate is convenient but can be pricier at scale. If you have steady high load, EC2 with ECS might be cheaper. For moderate use or spiky traffic, Fargate is fine.
- **RDS instance size:** We used `db.t3.medium` (which is a burstable instance). For prod, might consider `db.t3.large` or aurora serverless depending on needs. Turn on storage auto-scaling if unpredictable growth.
- **Idle ALB:** ALB costs a base fee (around ~$16/mo as of writing) plus LCU (capacity units for data). If this is just dev/test and not always needed, you could tear it down or use it on and off. In prod, it's essential and cost justified for availability.
- **Use Spot for ECS:** If some tasks are non-critical or can handle interruption (stateless web can often, if behind ALB), you could use Fargate Spot for some tasks. This could cut costs significantly but ensure you have at least some on-demand tasks for stability.
- **Data transfer:** Keep the ALB and ECS tasks in same AZs (ALB tries to send to same AZ targets to minimize cross-zone traffic unless cross-zone is on which then each request might incur small cost between AZs). Cross-zone is usually worth the small cost for better balance though.
- **Terraform plan frequency:** Using Terraform Cloud or remote, minimize overly frequent plans/applies on large infrastructure. Each apply can potentially cause downtime if mistakes are made. Use `terraform plan` to review changes carefully on prod.

### 9.5 Using Terraform Plan and State for Troubleshooting

Terraform’s plan is your friend to see what will change. If unsure, do `terraform plan` and inspect. The `-target` flag is useful if you want to apply just one part (like `terraform apply -target=aws_ecs_service.app_service` to just update the service).

For deep debugging, `terraform state show <resource>` can show what TF knows about a resource, which sometimes reveals drift or unexpected values.

If a resource is stuck or broken, sometimes you might import an existing one or remove it. For example, if you manually changed something in AWS console, you might import it into state to reconcile or adjust TF config accordingly.

**tfstate and secrets:** Ensure state (if local) is protected because it contains sensitive values (like the DB password). Use remote backends with encryption and limited access, as mentioned in section 1. 

Now as the final part, we consolidate the key **security best practices** touched on throughout the sections, to ensure your Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure is secure and compliant.

## 10. Security Best Practices

This section summarizes security best practices for Terraform configurations and AWS resources we’ve discussed, and adds any additional considerations. Security must be baked into every layer: IAM, network, data, and pipeline.

### 10.1 IAM and Access Management

- **Least Privilege IAM Policies:** Whether it’s the IAM role running Terraform or the IAM roles Terraform creates (like ECS task role, etc.), grant only needed permissions. Overly broad permissions can be dangerous if credentials leak or code has bugs. Use Access Analyzer and IAM policy simulator to refine policies.
- **Use IAM Roles for Terraform:** Prefer short-lived credentials. For example, use an IAM role in AWS CloudShell or an EC2 instance profile to run Terraform, instead of long-term AWS keys. If using CI tools, use OIDC federated roles (GitHub Actions can assume a role via OIDC without static creds).
- **Rotate Secrets:** If you must use static AWS keys (e.g., on a developer machine), rotate them regularly and avoid embedding in code or state. Use environment variables or a credentials file as Terraform will pick those up (and those stay outside Terraform config).
- **Unique IAM Entities:** If using IAM users for automation (not recommended, prefer roles), ensure they are distinct from humans and have an appropriate name and policy. It's mentioned to use unique IAM users with legacy automation if roles cannot be used.
- **MFA for Console Access:** Not directly Terraform-related, but anyone with AWS access (especially if broad) should use MFA. Also consider requiring MFA for certain API calls via IAM conditions if feasible.

### 10.2 Network Security (VPC, SG, ALB)

- **Network Isolation:** Deploy resources in private subnets unless absolutely needed in public. Our ECS tasks and RDS were in private subnets, only ALB was public. This limits exposure.
- **Security Group Least Privilege:** Start with deny-all (default) and open only what’s necessary. We gave examples: only ALB can talk to ECS tasks, only app can talk to DB. Do not allow wide open SG rules except where needed (ALB 80/443 for world is normal for a public site, but ensure at least ALB to app is locked down).
- **No Public DB Access:** RDS `publicly_accessible=false` and SG restricting access ensures the database isn’t reachable from the internet. If developers need direct DB access, go through a VPN or bastion.
- **ALB Security:** Use HTTPS listeners only, redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Keep the TLS policy updated (AWS provides predefined ones, use the latest that clients allow). Consider enabling AWS WAF on ALB for extra layer.
- **Secrets in Transit:** Make sure any client connecting (e.g., your app to DB) uses encryption. For example, enable SSL for MySQL connection. ALB to client is HTTPS as covered. Internally, if compliance requires, you might use TLS for internal comms too.
- **AWS NACLs (Network ACLs):** They can be used for an additional stateless layer of security at subnet level, but security groups usually suffice. If using NACLs, ensure they don’t inadvertently block necessary ephemeral ports or ALB health checks.

### 10.3 Data Protection

- **Encrypt Data at Rest:** We enabled RDS encryption with KMS. Also consider:
  - S3 buckets (if any used) should have encryption (AES-256 or KMS) by default.
  - EBS volumes (if any EC2 used) encrypted.
  - If using EFS for ECS tasks, enable encryption there too.
- **Encrypt Data in Transit:** Use HTTPS for APIs, TLS for database connections (RDS can enforce TLS, or at least require using the SSL mode on client). The security pillar suggests TLS 1.2+ for all communications.
- **Secrets Management:** Do not store plaintext secrets in Terraform code or state. For example, instead of putting DB password in plain text, consider:
  - Using `terraform apply -var="db_master_password=...` so it’s not saved in code (still ends in state though).
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to hold secrets and have ECS task pull them (ECS supports injecting secrets from these services into containers).
  - Terraform can read from Secrets Manager via `data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version"` if needed, but careful not to store result in state if not necessary.
  - If secrets *are* in state, make sure state is encrypted (S3 backend with SSE), and restricted.
- **Secure Terraform State:** As mentioned, use remote state with encryption and access control. If using local, ensure the file is not committed to VCS and perhaps stored on encrypted disk.

### 10.4 Compliance Considerations

If your infrastructure needs to comply with standards (HIPAA, PCI, SOC2, etc.):
- **HIPAA:** Ensure all ePHI data stores are encrypted at rest (RDS, S3, etc.), encrypted in transit (require TLS), and that access is restricted to minimum necessary (IAM and SGs). Turn on auditing/logging (e.g., MySQL general log or CloudTrail logs for RDS API actions).
- **PCI:** Similar to above, plus segmentation of cardholder data environment. Perhaps use separate VPC or security group isolation for anything that touches card data.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Enable CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, etc., to monitor changes and access. For example, AWS Config rules can ensure security groups are not open to world on DB ports, etc.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Our config kept 7-day backups. For stronger compliance, consider longer retention or cross-region backups (Aurora or custom snapshot copy).
- **Disaster Recovery:** Multi-AZ RDS helps locally. Consider cross-region replication or at least snapshot exports for DR. For ECS, ensure you can rehydrate in another region if needed with your Terraform code.

### 10.5 DevOps and Pipeline Security

- **Terraform State Protection:** As a team, restrict who can read production state (contains sensitive info). Use IAM policies to restrict the S3 bucket and DynamoDB (for state locking) to only CICD or admins.
- **Plan Reviews:** In a team setting, always have someone review `terraform plan` output for changes, especially destructive ones. Use Terraform Cloud/Enterprise or Atlantis to have VCS-based workflows.
- **Sentinel/Policy as Code:** HashiCorp Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA) can enforce rules on Terraform. For example, a policy to prevent opening an RDS SG to 0.0.0.0/0 or to require `encrypted = true` on all volumes. This can catch misconfigurations early.
- **Static Analysis:** Use tools like **Checkov** or **tfsec** to scan Terraform code for security issues (they have rules like "no hardcoded creds", "S3 buckets should have versioning", etc.). This is part of "shift-left" security – catching issues before deploy.
- **Continuous Scanning:** AWS Security Hub, Amazon Inspector can continuously scan running resources for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. For example, Inspector can check your ECS task images for vulnerabilities. Security Hub can aggregate findings, including some AWS Config rules for our resources (like it will warn if ALB is not using HTTPS or if S3 bucket is public, etc).
- **Rotate and Manage Keys:** If any keys (SSH keys for EC2 perhaps, or KMS keys), have a rotation strategy. AWS KMS can auto-rotate CMKs yearly if enabled. IAM access keys should be rotated every 90 days (some orgs enforce via config).
- **Incident Response:** Tag resources with owner/application, so if something is flagged (like GuardDuty finding on an EC2, or unusual API call via Terraform user), you know who to contact or what application might be affected.

### 10.6 Principle of Least Privilege Recap

To cap it off, remember the *Principle of Least Privilege* across all these:
- IAM: minimal rights.
- SG/NACL: minimal network access.
- S3 Bucket policies: only allow necessary principals.
- Parameter Store/Secrets Manager: restrict who (which IAM roles) can read secrets.
- Even Terraform itself: use `-target` carefully to limit scope of changes when needed (not exactly least privilege, but least impact principle).

Finally, keep aware of updates:
- Terraform AWS Provider updates sometimes add new features (like recently the ability to manage certain new resources). Keep provider updated but test changes as they sometimes have slight behavior changes.
- AWS adds new security features (e.g., RDS might add support for new auth like IAM authentication, which you might leverage; or ECS adds new capacity provider strategies).
- Patching: ensure your ECS task images are rebuilt often to include security patches for the OS and libraries (maybe use ECR image scanning or Docker Hub dependabot alerts).
